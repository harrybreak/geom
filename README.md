# Computational Geometry Project
> *Yeuems Thien Long, Tudor Cosmin Alexandre, Puech Lilian*

This project is about experimenting and comparing two collision test algorithms : SAT and GJK. Both have their own characteritics that you are invited to explore by testing the code on your side.

## Project description

The project provides a 2D graphic engine working with SDL2 to visualize collision tests computed on polygons. The program has not been designed to be versatile or crossed into other projects and copying our code is prohibited because of considered as plagiarism. This application was programmed as part of the end of semester project of the Computational Geometry course at the Free University of Brussels.

## Build instructions

### Unix system (Linux distributions and MacOS)

 * Compilation using CMake but easier : launch ``./build.sh``
 * Execute the program by launching ``./build/Simulator``

### Windows

 * ...really???
